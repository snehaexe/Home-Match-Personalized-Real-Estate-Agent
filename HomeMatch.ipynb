    "# Personalized Real estate Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "### AIML STREAM \n",
    "#### Name: Sneha Chakrabartty\n",
    "\n",
    "This project utilizes the fundamentals of GenAI and it's use in the industry as a personalized recommendation system. This project is inclined towards fulfillment of the (Udacity nanodegree Final Project) AI/ML stream (Accenture Track). It demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs), vector databases, and Retrieval-Augumented Generation (RAG) can be combined to build a `Personalized Real Estate Recommendation Assistant`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project the system does the following processes:\n",
    " - Synthetic data Generation: In this step the real estate listings are synthetically generated using LLM (Openai-3.5-Turbo) using a structured templates\n",
    " - Semantic Search: After generating synthetic data for real estate listings we store it into a vector database so that we can perform similarity search based on user preferences.\n",
    " - Augumented Response Generation: Once the synthetic listings are stored inside a vector database, the next step is to allow the system to retrieve the most relevant homes based on the buyer's preferences. This is done using RAG (Retrieval-Augumented Generation)\n",
    " - After this the most relevant lisitngs have been retrieved using semantic search, the next step is to personalize each listing so the output feels tailored uniquely to the buyer. This is done by utilizing `Conversational buffer memory` and `RAG-based contextual response generation`.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Project Objectives and Tasks:**\n",
    "Imagine you're a talented developer at \"Future Homes Realty\", a forward-thinking real estate company. In an industry where personalization is key to customer satisfaction, your company wants to revolutionize how clients interact with real estate listings. The goal is to create a personalized experience for each buyer, making the property search process more engaging and tailored to individual preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge**\n",
    "Your task is to develop an innovative application named \"HomeMatch\". This application leverages large language models (LLMs) and vector databases to transform standard real estate listings into personalized narratives that resonate with potential buyers' unique preferences and needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Components of \"HomeMatch\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Buyer Preferences:**\n",
    "Buyers will input their requirements and preferences, such as location, property type, budget, amenities, and lifestyle choices.\n",
    "The application uses LLMs to interpret these inputs in natural language, understanding nuanced requests beyond basic filters.\n",
    "Integrating with a Vector Database:\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect \"HomeMatch\" with a vector database, where all available property listings are stored.\n",
    "Utilize vector embeddings to match properties with buyer preferences, focusing on aspects like neighborhood vibes, architectural styles, and proximity to specific amenities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personalized Listing Description Generation:**\n",
    "For each matched listing, use an LLM to rewrite the description in a way that highlights aspects most relevant to the buyer’s preferences.\n",
    "Ensure personalization emphasizes characteristics appealing to the buyer without altering factual information about the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Listing Presentation:**\n",
    "Output the personalized listing(s) as a text description of the listing."
